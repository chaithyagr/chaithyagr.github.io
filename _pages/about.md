I am a Research Engineer at CEA Paris Saclay, working in the [INRIA-CEA Parietal Team](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/), with [Dr Philippe CIUCIU](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=X-w36z8AAAAJ&hl=fr). I work on Compressed Sensing and its application to Imagining applications, particularly MRI. We strive towards obtaining higher resolution MR scans from a scan of significantly reduced scan time. My interests include signal processing, mathematical modelling and computer architecture. Overall I have love to learn new things and stay curious.

I like to swim, skate, and play basketball. I love to travel places and meet new people and explore new cultures and traditions. A like to do some minute hobby photography and have a keen interest in architectures of monuments from different places. I read occasionaly and binge pretty much in every vacation :P .
