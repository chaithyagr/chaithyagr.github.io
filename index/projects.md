					<h3>Brain Metabolite Profiling and its uses in Disease Modelling</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy is an effective tool which can be used to measure concentrations of metabolites in various brain regions. This has wide applications in disease modeling and treatment due to which it is really important that this is brought into a clinical setting as soon as possible. To ensure this, the data from MRS must be reflected with reliability indicators and the results must be standardized. Also there is a need to form a baseline of such concentrations so that we have a comparative measure to quantify changes in brain. Once this is done, the results could be used in assessing which concentrations of metabolites in brain regions could have higher correlation to a particular health condition and thus can be used to analyze how effective it is in being a robust bio-marker.

					<h3>IEEE SP Cup 2017: Real Time Beat Tracking</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				Tracking beats while listening to music is an innate ability of humans. It is expressed in the form of tapping and clapping. Previously, there have been several non-causal attempts to mimic this action. Algorithmic beat tracking is a challenge for real-time implementation. We implement a causal beat tracking algorithm which includes onset detection, Beats Per Minute (BPM) estimation, beat phase estimation and beat prediction. In addition, we propose a novel cost function for beat prediction. The entire algorithm is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 and creative light displays are used to highlight the underlying beat structure in music.

					<h3>IEEE SP Cup 2016: ENF Based Forensics</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				The electric network frequency (ENF) is a signature of power distribution networks . This can be captured by multimedia signals recorded near electrical activities. These ENF signals have multiple forensic applications. Examples of such applications include validating the time-of-recording of an ENF-containing media signal or estimating its recording location. In this paper, we examine an ENF-based application that infers the power grid in which the ENF-containing multimedia signal was recorded. We investigate various features based on the statistical differences in ENF signal obtained from different power grids to serve as signatures for the region-of-recording of the media signal. We use these features and implement a machine learning algorithm that is able to identify the power grid of the ENF extracted with high accuracy.

					<h3>Vocal Tract Estimation in High Pitched Voices</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				Vocal tract estimation is highly useful for many speech signal processing applications. Earlier methods to do these involved many spectral methods such as Linear predictive Coding, Cepstral Smoothing of amplitude spectrum and other interpolation schemes. However such methods are limited to the cases of lower pitches wherein the amplitude spectrum has sufficient information. At higher pitches it is necessary to search for different methods to carry out this vocal tract estimation. In this project we implement various methods already available and we try to develop our own method to improve the performance.
